**Flag:**
fastctf{a_bit_tricky}

**Steps:**

1.  **Reading the File:**
    
    -   The script opens the file "bits.txt" in binary reading mode (`'rb'`). This ensures all bytes are read accurately.
    -   The entire file content is read into a byte array using  `infile.read()`.
2.  **Extracting Encoded Message:**
    
    -   An empty string (`flag`) is initialized to store the final extracted flag.
    -   Another empty string (`s`) is used as a temporary buffer.
    -   The script iterates through each byte (`i`) in the data:
        -   The byte is converted to its binary representation using  `bin(i)[2:]`. This removes the leading "0b" from the binary string.
        -   The binary string is zero-padded to ensure a length of 8 bits using  `zfill(8)`.
        -   This 8-bit binary string is then appended to the  `msg_bits`  string, which is being constructed to hold all the encoded message bits.
3.  **Shifting and Completing the Encoded Message:**
    
    -   A new string  `msg_bits_left`  is created to hold the shifted and completed encoded message.
    -   The original  `msg_bits`  string is sliced to exclude the first bit (left-shifted by 1):  `msg_bits[1:]`.
    -   A "1" bit is appended to the end of  `msg_bits_left`  using string concatenation (`msg_bits_left += "1"`). This additional bit might be crucial for decoding depending on the specific encoding scheme used in the challenge.
4.  **Decoding the Encoded Message:**
    
    -   The  `convert_bits_msg`  function takes the  `msg_bits_left`  string (containing the shifted and completed encoded message) as input.
    -   This function iterates through the  `msg_bits_left`  string in chunks of 8 bits.
    -   For each 8-bit chunk, it converts the binary string to its decimal equivalent using  `int(msg_bits[i: i + 8], 2)`.
    -   Finally, it converts the decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character using  `chr`.
    -   These characters are then concatenated and returned as the decoded message.
5.  **Printing the Flag:**
    
    -   The script calls the  `convert_bits_msg`  function with the processed  `msg_bits_left`  string.
    -   The decoded message, which is expected to be the flag, is printed to the console.
