**Explanation:**

-   **Function Name:**  `add_images_mod256`  clearly describes the function's purpose.
-   **Docstring:**
    -   Summarizes the function's functionality: Reads two images, adds pixels, performs modulo 256, and saves the result.
    -   Lists the function arguments:
        -   `image1_path`: Path to the first image file (string).
        -   `image2_path`: Path to the second image file (string).
        -   `output_path`: Path to save the resulting image (string).
    -   Mentions the potential  `ValueError`  exception raised if the input images have different dimensions.
-   **Comments:**  While not explicitly present in this code snippet, adding comments within the function can further explain specific code sections, especially for complex logic.

**Example Usage:**

The provided code demonstrates how to use the `add_images_mod256` function by:

-   Specifying paths for the two input images (`image1_path`  and  `image2_path`).
-   Defining the desired output path (`output_path`).
-   Calling the function with these arguments.

This example clarifies how users can interact with the function.

**Exploring Other Approaches (Optional):**

While adding corresponding pixels and performing modulo 256 might be the solution in this specific scenario, it's valuable to explore alternative approaches, especially in CTF contexts. Here's one example that wasn't successful:

-   **XOR Operation:**
    -   Logic: XOR (exclusive or) operation on corresponding pixels could have been attempted. It sets a bit to 1 only if the bits in the corresponding positions of the operands are different.
